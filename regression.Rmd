R-squared is fairly low (.36), however, transission type is significant

```{r}
boxplot(mpg~am, data=mtcars, main= "Overall MPG by Type", names=c("automatic", "manual"))
```
at face value-- manual appears to have better MPG-- however, the average for automatic is contained within the error bars for automatic
```{r}
pairs(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)
```
```{r}
mvr <- lm(mpg~am + wt + hp + cyl, data = mtcars)
summary(mvr)
anova(ammod,mvr)
```
A more Inclusive Model reduces the residual sum of squares significantly
```{r}
plot(mvr)
```
```{r}
plot(ammod)
```
